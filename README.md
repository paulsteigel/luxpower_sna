Hi All Hobyists,
This component to help you (at your owned risk) run an esphome LuxPower logger from a remote site and publish data to a Home Assistant server via MQTT, Iâ€™ve started working on a solution based on insights from the excellent LuxPython_DEV project, which provides a Python-based integration for Home Assistant.
While that integration works well, it requires users to open a port and configure port forwarding to the WiFi dongle on the remote router. This setup might be fine in some countries, but in parts of Vietnamâ€”where ISPs often assign non-public (local) WAN IPsâ€”remote access becomes impossible.
As a first milestone, I now have a working ESP32-based LuxPower logger using ESPHome firmware. It supports read-only mode and can expose almost all available sensors from the LuxPower Integration.
To use this custom component, simply add the following to your ESPHome YAML configuration:
# External component definitions:
external_components: # skip this line if you already have this
```
#Add the two following lines
  - source: github://paulsteigel/luxpower_sna@main

#Definition for the component
luxpower_sna:
  id: luxpower_hub
  host: "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx" # Internal IP address of your Wifi Dongle
  port: 8000
  dongle_serial: "xxxxxxxxxx" # Your Dongle Serial
  inverter_serial_number: "xxxxxxxxxx" # Your Inverter serial number. Currently this is not needed but just leave it
  update_interval: 20s
  
# Definition sensors, you should be selective on the following sensor, keep what you need for later Lovelace UI CARD
sensor:
  - platform: luxpower_sna
    id: my_luxpower_sna # Replace with the ID of your luxpower_sna component

Hereâ€™s a snapshot of the sensor list on my combined ESP32-S2 Lolin logger for JKBMS and LuxPower:

I'm excited to share that the logger is already functional in read-only mode, and it integrates almost all the sensors available in the official LuxPower Integration.
In the coming days, Iâ€™ll begin adding support for buttons, switches, and time-based controlâ€”making it possible to fully control your LuxPower inverter just as easily as with the original Integration by @guybw's team. I also plan to design a Lovelace card to improve the Home Assistant dashboard experience. ðŸ”— Component link: https://github.com/paulsteigel/luxpower_sna
